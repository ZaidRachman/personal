        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Student</p>
        <p>I am a student at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering. 
            I work part-time as a Network Operations Specialist
            where I monitor and troubleshoot issues from over a hundred stations across the country.

                <h3>Pet-Net</h3>
                <p>
                    Pet-Net was my Capstone project when I was a student at Kirkwood.
                    The task was to build a full stack project from scratch.
                    I worked with a group of 27 other students to plan,
                    create diagrams, test, and implement a variety of different
                    features. At the end, we were able to present our project to a group of employers.
                    We used several languages such as: C#,SQL,HTML,CSS, and Javascript.

                <h3>Frog Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Frog game is a project I worked on with a group of friends in Game Maker Studio. Frog game is a platformer that required the player
                    to swing from obstacle to obstacle to reach the end of the level. This project is still a work in progress.

                <h3>Javascript Project</h3>
                <p>
                    In my Javascript class at Kirkwood Community College,
                    we had to create and develop a webpage using real website
                    as reference as our final project. I created a page mimicking
                    a Hy-Vee job listing. Using a combination of HTML, CSS,
                    and Javascript I had created a fully functioning webpage with text-field requirements.
